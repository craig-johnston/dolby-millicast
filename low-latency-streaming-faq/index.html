      <h3>
        There are several options, the best solution for you depends on your use case and requirements. If 30-60 seconds latency is acceptable for your stream, you can use just about any existing solution on the market from CDN providers.  If you need better than 30 seconds there are specialized media server software providers which can help you solve this problem.
        </br>If you want TRUE real-time latency streaming you have two options:</br>

      <h2>
        For ultra low and realtime latency, what are the advantages of a fully managed solution?
      </h2>
      <h3>
        <b>- No setup required, instant activation.</b></br>
        Simply activate your account and you can begin streaming to your audience instantly, at any scale.
        </br></br>
        <b>- Affordability</b></br>
        The time, money and risk required to properly configure, deploy, scale and manage your own infrastructure is far more expensive than a hosted solution like Millicast.
        </br></br>
        <b>- Security</b></br>
        To properly secure your streams and infrastructure from unauthorized access requires advanced knowledge and experience. With Millicast this is built into the service by industry experts who understand the importance of securing your streams.
        </br></br>
        <b>- Future proof</b></br>
        Regardless of changes to device support, browsers or protocols, updates to the service are updated and deployed for you with no extra cost, time or attention required.
